## TypeScript

TypeScript is an essential tool for ensuring type safety and improving code quality during development. It allows you to create interfaces, classes and functions with specific types. This means that every element of the code has a defined type, which helps reduce errors. For example, if a function expects a number but receives a string, TypeScript will signal an error before the code is even executed.

## Webpack

This project focuses on configuring Webpack for a basic web development environment. Webpack is a tool that helps organize and optimize the files in your web project. It takes all the files (such as JavaScript, CSS, and images) and groups them into one or more “bundle” files that can be easily loaded by the browser. By configuring Webpack, you can automate tasks such as code minification (making code smaller so that it loads faster) and dependency management (ensuring that all necessary files are included). This makes development more efficient and improves your website's performance.
